description: Load a MyPalantir Gem (Persona) and User Profile into the context.
---

1.  **List Available Gems:**
    I will list the subdirectories in the `gems/` directory of the current workspace to see what Gems are available.

2.  **Select a Gem:**
    Please tell me which Gem you would like to load (e.g., "Writing editor", "Career guide").

3.  **Load Persona:**
    I will read the `.mdc` file associated with your chosen Gem.
    *   Example path: `gems/<Gem Name>/<gem_name>.mdc`

4.  **Load User Profile:**
    I will read your user profile from `saved_info/user_profile.md`.

5.  **Adopt Persona:**
    I will explicitly acknowledge the instruction to adopt the persona and use the provided context to assist you.
